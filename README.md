[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/MelonLoader-0.2.6-green.svg)]()

Universal Runtime Inspector/Explorer for Unity Il2CPP games.

## How to install

This requires [MelonLoader](https://github.com/HerpDerpinstine/MelonLoader) to be installed for your game.

1. Download <b>CppExplorer.dll</b> from the Releases folder.
2. Put the file in your `MyGame/Mods/` folder.

## How to use

* Press F7 to show or hide the menu.
* Currently does <b>not</b> grant locked mouse or prevent clicking-through the menu, be careful of this.
* Simply browse through the scene, search for objects, etc, it's pretty self-explanatory.

If you have any specific questions about it you can contact me here, on NexusMods (Sinaioutlander), or on Discord (Sinai#4637, in MelonLoader discord).
